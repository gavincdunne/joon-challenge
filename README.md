## _React Native web and mobile app_

### Main areas of focus
After 7 years away from it, I returned to React Native with a fresh perspective, delving into TypeScript for the first time. 
Much of my coding time was dedicated to reacquainting myself with the framework, particularly in terms of state management across the 4-screen flow. 
Leveraging Redux, a tool I had prior experience with but hadn't fully grasped, proved invaluable. Looking back on my return to React Native after years in Android development, 
I enjoyed the chance to breeze through a straightforward flow, leveraging my extensive mobile experience to bring clarity to the process.
  
### How long the project took
  As I was using this project as a bit of a study guide as I went along, it probably took me a little longer; actual coding time was around 8 hours.

### Anything else...
  There was at least one error that popped up that I didn't have time to debug. Although it seemed like a dire warning, it didn't have an effect on the app as far as I could tell. More
  testing needed. I think it is probably a common React Native pitfall that is easily solved, but I just haven't been working in the framework enough to know the solution.
